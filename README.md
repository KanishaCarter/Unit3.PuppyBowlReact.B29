Overview
You have already built a Puppy Bowl application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now it is time to optimize using React. 

There are three tabs below. Make sure to review each before beginning.

Getting StartedRequirementsSubmission
The API
You can find the documentation for our "Puppy Bowl" API hereLinks to an external site.. You have learned this before, but it is a good idea to re-read through it to remember what routes are available to call and what type of data you will be working on within this project.

Summing It Up
As the web developer for a site like this, your job will be to handle the data about each of our puppy competitors and their owners. To that purpose, you will be interacting with the "Puppy Bowl" API we have built that hosts the data you will need about each puppy, each of its owners, and even the teams they are on. You will make certain requests to our API to get the appropriate data you will need, save that to the state of your React app, and then build various React components to represent that state to your users visually.

Getting Started 
For this project, you will not have a GitHub repository to clone and work from. Instead, you will build a React app from scratch. 

If you would like a written guide on how to get started, you can check out this resource hereLinks to an external site..

Like the previous project, you will have creative freedom regarding how you want to represent that data visually. However, there are a few requirements that we will ask you to complete as well. We will talk about those in the next section.

Functional Requirements
Your site's users should be able to:

See a list of each player competing in the bowl.
Click a "See Details" button or something similar on each player that will lead you to another page view with specific details on that player, such as owner and team name.
Have a form to CREATE a new player.
Search for a specific player in a search bar and see a new list with only puppies with names that match the text in the search bar.
Create a button to DELETE a player (ONLY DELETE PLAYERS YOU YOURSELF CREATE, PLEASE!)
Coding Requirements
Your code uses or employs best coding practices regarding:

Variable declaration
Loop usage
Control structures (i.e., if, else-if)
Function declarations
Function invocations
Usage of basic data types (i.e., strings, numbers, booleans)
Usage of complex data types (i.e., objects, arrays)
DOM manipulation, including template and rendering, element queries, event listeners, and the update state to render state process
Best CSS practices, including proper use of flexboxes, grids, and proper use of cascading/specificity
Developing a good user experience through a clean, easily navigable, and aesthetically pleasing user interface (UI)
Creating functional React components, including state management, JSX code blocks, and hook usage

Submission
Submit a GitHub link (make sure it is set to public) and link to a deployed application in your README.MD file.  Review the deployment process here, as needed.
